# Airplane Crash Reasons Text Mining #
This repository hosts Python code for my analysis on airplane crashes. 

## Description ##
Data source: [Kaggle - Airplane Crashes Since 1908](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908 "Kaggle - Airplane Crashes Since 1908")
The data source offers a description of the dataset. The insight I hope to uncover from the comments associated with crashes is the reasons for crashing. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used for topic modeling.

## Requirements ##
* `Python`
* Commonly used analytical packages `pandas`, `numpy`, `sci-kit learn`, and `matplotlib`.
* Natural Language Toolkit `nltk` for natural language processing.
